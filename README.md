## 1. Category Cards

```
On the homepage, users can see four category cards: Health, Education, Food, and Cloth.
When a user clicks on a category card, they are taken to a details page for that category.
Each category details page provides information about why users should consider donating to that specific cause.
Users will find a "Donate" button on each category details page to make a donation to that cause.
Example:

Clicking on the "Health" category card takes the user to a page explaining why donations to health-related causes are important. There, they can click the "Donate" button to contribute to health-related initiatives.
```



## 2. Statistics and Pie Chart
```
The navigation bar also includes a "Statistics" link.
Clicking on the "Statistics" link takes users to a page displaying the percentage breakdown of donations for each category using a pie chart.
Example:

Clicking on the "Statistics" link in the navigation bar opens a page showing a pie chart that visually represents the distribution of donations among the four categories.
```

## 3. Search Bar
```
The website features a search bar that allows users to search for any category they are interested in.
Users can quickly find a category by typing its name into the search bar, and the website will display matching results.
Example:

If a user wants to find the "Education" category quickly, they can use the search bar and type "Education." The website will then display search results, making it easy to access the Education category.
